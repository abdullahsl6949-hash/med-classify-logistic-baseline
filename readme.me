# Breast Cancer Detection (Logistic Regression)

This project uses Logistic Regression to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

## Workflow
- Data preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling
- Logistic Regression model training
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

## Dataset
Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (from Scikit-learn)

## Results
Model achieves strong classification performance on test data.
